# Motivation

The world is increasingly demanding better and faster access to information. With advances in commodity hardware, and the rise of commodity computing, it has provided means to address one of the ways to increase performance. The proposed ways are as follows - a) Word harder, b) Work smarter and c) Get help, as outlined in [G. Pfsiter, In Search of Clusters]. Commodity computing has been able to address how to get help, namely distribution of work across machines. Caches attempt to address how to work smarter, particularly how to perform less computation.

The increase of distributed computing has also introduced new challenges such as consistency and resiliency of the network under question. The same challenges are having to be addressed across the application stack, including the caching mechanism. With advances in hardware performance and also the size of networks, it will increasingly essential to be able to make caching systems as effective as possible. Inherently, multi-threded and distributed computing poses


With the increased usage of commodity computing [G. Pfister, In Search of Clusters, Prentice Hall PTR, 1998], it has become possible to utilize larger



1. We need to be able to scale on a single server better
2. We need to be able to scale across servers better
3. We need to see if multi-threaded approach is better than single threaded with simpler system
