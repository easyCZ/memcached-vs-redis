# Memcached

## Outline
Memcached is a simple distributed memory object cache [1]. It provides a simple interface to allow systems to store, retrieve and update the contents of the cache. It is developed as an open source project and has been extensively studied in the literature. Often, it is used as an application of choice to benchmark system configurations in terms of network throughput, memory allocation policies and more generally to understand how a system performs under stress. Furthermore, it is often used as an application for experiementation and implementation of next generation technology such as the use of a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) [2].

The API supported by memcached is straightforward. Memcached philosophy is to execute commands against an item of the cache rather than manipulate the cache as a whole. Out of the box, memcached supports the following operations for retrieval: *set, add, replace, append, prepend and cas* [3]. Similarly, memcached supports the following storage commands: *get, gets, delete and incr/decr* [3]. The API is deliberetly designed to be intuitive making the effect of an action predictable. The action labelled *cas* perhaps requires further clarification, however. The full action name is *check and set*, data is stored only if the comparison with current value fails.

Memcached has grown to be a very popular general purpose cache in the industry. Currently, Facebook is considered to have the largest deployment of memcached in production [4] while there are many other companies utilizing large deployments of memcached as building blocks of their infrastructure, these include Twitter[5], Amazon [6] and many others. 

In the simplest memcached deployment, an instance of memcached can be run alongside another application, for example a web server. In such a setup, no network communication is required and the web server can talk to memcached over a local unix socket. This configuration has disadvantages, for example, horizontally scaling the web server would require another instance of the cache to be deployed as well potentially leading decreased cache hit rate.

More complicated deployments generally utilize a memcached instance running on a seperate host with all instances of, for example, web servers communicating with a single memcached host. The advantage of such a setup is decreased coupling and increased potential for scalability by adding more instances of both web server and memcached.

In the largest scenarios, such as Facebook, a large number of client applications are talking to a number of memcached clusters responsible for a given type of information. Effectively creating a data layer where any client application can request information from any pool increasing modularity and interoperability of the infrastructure. [Ref?] 

(Diagram to illustrate deployments here?)

To illustrate the importance and also the size of a memcached deployment, a workload charasterization from Facebook will be used [7]. Figure below illustrates the throughput observed in a Facebook pools deployed over the course of 7 days. We can observe that the total number of requests is close to 1.26 trillion requests over 7 days, this is on average 2.08 million requests a second. The volume itself is large, however, considering Facebook has 1.44 billion active monthly users [8], however, it does demonstrate the scale at which Facebook utilizes memcached and the impact memcached has on ability to scale and handle traffic at Facebook.

## Design decisions
From the early development stages, memcached has been designed in a client-server architecture. Therefore, a memcached applications receives a command based on its API, executes the command and returns a reply to the client. Memcached is deliberetly designed as a standalone application rather than being integrated into a particular system/framework in order to be able to act as a general purpose cache and allow decoupling of responsibilities in an system architecture.

Memcached implements its distributed protocol through consistent hashing on the client side. Therefore, keeping logic on the server side minimal and allowing the clients to figure out which instance to talk to. In order to further improve horizontal scaling properties of memcached, solutions such as Twemproxy [9] exist to support scalability of an individual shard of a distributed memcached deployment.
