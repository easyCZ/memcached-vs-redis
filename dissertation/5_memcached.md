# Memcached

## Outline
Memcached is a simple distributed memory object cache [1]. It provides a simple interface to allow systems to store, retrieve and update the contents of the cache. It is developed as an open source project and has been extensively studied in the literature. Often, it is used as an application of choice to benchmark system configurations in terms of network throughput, memory allocation policies and more generally to understand how a system performs under stress. Furthermore, it is often used as an application for experiementation and implementation of next generation technology such as the use of a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) [2].

The API supported by memcached is straightforward. Memcached philosophy is to execute commands against an item of the cache rather than manipulate the cache as a whole. Out of the box, memcached supports the following operations for retrieval: *set, add, replace, append, prepend and cas* [3]. Similarly, memcached supports the following storage commands: *get, gets, delete and incr/decr* [3]. The API is deliberetly designed to be intuitive making the effect of an action predictable. The action labelled *cas* perhaps requires further clarification, however. The full action name is *check and set*, data is stored only if the comparison with current value fails.

Memcached has grown to be a very popular general purpose cache in the industry. Currently, Facebook is considered to have the largest deployment of memcached in production [4] while there are many other companies utilizing large deployments of memcached as building blocks of their infrastructure, these include Twitter[5], Amazon [6] and many others. 

## Design decisions
From the early development stages, memcached has been designed in a client-server architecture. Therefore, a memcached applications receives a command based on its API, executes the command and returns a reply to the client. Memcached is deliberetly designed as a standalone application rather than being integrated into a particular system/framework in order to be able to act as a general purpose cache and allow decoupling of responsibilities in an system architecture.
