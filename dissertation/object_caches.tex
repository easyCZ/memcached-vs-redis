\section{Memory Object Caches}

Firstly, the purpose of a memory object cache is to use the machine's available RAM for key-value storage. The implication of a \textit{memory object cache} is that data is only stored in memory and should not be offloaded on the hardware in order to not incur hard drive retrieval delay. As a result, memory caches are often explicitly configured with the maximum amount of memory available.

Secondly, an \textit{object} cache implies that the cache itself is not concerned with the type of data (binary, text) stored within. As a result, memory object caches are multi-purpose caches capable of storage of any data type within size restrictions imposed by the cache.

Finally, memory object caches can be deployed as single purpose servers or also co-located with another deployment. Consequently, general purpose object caches often provide multiple protocols for accessing the cache - socket communication or TCP over the network. Both caches in question - Memcached and Redis - support both deployment strategies. Our primary focus will be on networked protocols used to access the cache.


\subsection{Desired qualities}
Firstly, an object cache should support a simple interface providing the following operations - \textit{get}, \textit{set} and \textit{delete} to retrieve, store and invalidate an entry respectively.

Secondly, a general purpose object cache should have the capability to store items of arbitrary format and size provided the size satisfies the upper bound size constraints imposed by the cache. Making no distinction between the type of data is a fundamental generalization of an object cache and allows a greater degree of interoperability.

Thirdly, a cache should support operation atomicity in order to prevent data corruption resulting from multiple simultaneous writes.

Furthermore, cache operations should be performed efficiently, ideally in constant time and the cache should be capable of enforcing a consistent eviction policy in the case of memory bounds are exceeded.

Finally, a general purpose object cache should be capable of handling a large number of requests per second while maintaining a fair and as low as possible quality of service for all connected clients.


\subsection{Design and Implementations}
The design and implementation of a general purpose cache system is heavily influenced by the desired qualities of a cache.

Firstly, high performance requirement and the need for storage of entries of varying size generally requires the cache system to implement custom memory management models. As a result, a mapping data structure  with key hashing is used to efficiently locate entries in the cache.

Secondly, due to memory restrictions, the cache is responsible for enforcing an eviction policy. Most state of the art caches utilize least recently used (LRU) cache eviction policy, however, other policies such as first-in-first-out can also be used.

In the case of \textit{Memcached}, multi-threaded approach is utilized in order to improve performance. Conversely to Memcached, \textit{Redis} is implemented as a single threaded application and focuses primarily on a fast execution loop rather than parallel computation.


\subsection{Performance metrics}
Firstly, the primary metrics reflecting performance of an in memory object cache are \textit{mean latency}, \textit{99th percentile latency} and \textit{throughput}. Both latency statistics are reflective of the quality of service the cache is delivering to it's clients. Throughput is indicative of the overall load the cache is capable of supporting, however, throughput is tightly related to latency and on it's own is not indicative of the real cache performance under quality constraints.

Secondly, being a high performance application with potentially network, understanding the proportion of CPU time spent inside the cache application compared to time spent processing network requests and handling operating system calls becomes important. Having an insight into the CPU time breakdown allows us to better understand bottlenecks of the application.

Finally, the \textit{hit} and \textit{miss} rate of the cache can be used as a metric, particularly when evaluating a cache eviction policy, however, the hit and miss rate is tightly correlated with the type of application and the application context and therefore it is not a suitable metric for evaluating performance alone.


\subsection{Memcached}

Memcached is a ``high-performance, distributed memory object caching system, generic in nature, but intended for use in speeding up dynamic web applications by alleviating database load.'' \cite{interactive2006memcached} Despite the official description aimed at dynamic web applications, memcached is also used as a generic key value store to locate servers and services \cite{atikoglu2012workload}.

\subsubsection{Memcached API}
Memcached provides a simple communication protocol. It implements the following core operations:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{get key1 [key2..N]} - Retrieve one or more values for given keys,
    \item \texttt{set key value [flag] [expiration] [size]} - Insert \textit{key} into the cache with a \textit{value}. Overwrites current item.
    \item \texttt{delete key} - Delete a given key.
\end{itemize}

Memcached further implements additional useful operations such as \texttt{incr/decr} which increments or decrements a value and \texttt{append/prepend} which append or prepend a given key.

\subsubsection{Implementation}
Firstly, Memcached is implemented as a multi-threaded application. ``Memcache instance started with n threads will spawn n + 1 threads of which the first n are worker threads and the last
is a maintenance thread used for hash table expansion under high load factor.'' \cite{solarflarememcached}

Secondly, in order to provide performance as well as  portability, memcached is implemented on top of \textit{libevent} \cite{libevent}. ``The libevent API provides a mechanism to execute a callback function when a specific event occurs on a file descriptor or after a timeout has been reached. Furthermore, libevent also support callbacks due to signals or regular timeouts.'' \cite{libevent}

Thirdly, Memcached provides guarantees on the order of actions performed. Therefore, consecutive writes of the same key will result in the last incoming request being the retained by memcached. Consequently, all actions performed are internally atomic.

As a result, memcached employs a locking mechanism in order to be able to guarantee order of writes as well as execute concurrently. Internally, the process of handling a request is as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Requests are received by the Network Interface Controller (NIC) and queued
    \item \emph{Libevent} receives the request and delivers it to the memcached application
    \item A worker thread receives a request, parses it and determines the command required
    \item The \emph{key} in the request is used to calculate a hash value to access the memory location in \emph{O(1)}
    \item Cache lock is acquired \emph{(entering critical section)}
    \item Command is processed and LRU policy is enforced
    \item Cache lock is released \emph{(leaving critical section)}
    \item Response is constructed and transmitted \cite{wiggins2012enhancing}
\end{enumerate}

We can observe that steps \textit{1-4} and \textit{8} can be parallelized without the need for resource locking. However, the critical section in steps \textit{5-7} is executed with the acquisition of a global lock. Therefore, at this stage execute is not being performed in parallel.

% \subsection{Configuration options}
% Memcached provides a convenient command line configration options to tweak the performance of memcached through various parameters, the most important ones are:
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item \emph{-d} runs application in daemon mode
%     \item \emph{-p port} binds application to a port (18080 by default)
%     \item \emph{-m memory} defines how much memory to allocate to memcached.
% \end{itemize}

% Given the host hardware has 8GB memory, 6GB will be allocated to memcached to leave some memory for the underlying operating system. Throughout this paper, mostly options outlined above will be utilized. Where applicable, further settings will be explained.
